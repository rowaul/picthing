Picthing accepts (most?) images as input and draws them in the terminal using colored block characters. Automatically resizes images to fit the width of your terminal.

(1) Noticeably faster

(2) No longer requires Imagemagick

(3) Supports tab completion

(4) Masterpiece is no longer misspelled

**Note: Requires true color support**
